When using a remote repo many colaborator work with same repo 
hence when we need to push our changes to the the remote repo it may lead to CONFLICT if someones already pushed some changes to that repo which is conflicting.

Hence we will get an error if we try to push our changes leading to the conflict.

Hence , In this case the merge is not fast forward  we need to do Three waymerge.

*********to resolve this conflict ************

1:: Pull the remote repo 1st.

---> $ git pull         

2:: now see the log  of the remote repo to see what has been updated by the other colaborator(person working on same project).

 ---> $ git log -p origin/master

3:: also understand the conflict by observing the graphical view

---> $ git log --graph --oneline --all   // it will show a nice representation of the branches and every thing

4:: After understanding the conflict and the updation done
 open and edit all the conflict files one by one 

---> vi filename  // now we can see the changes made by other person and by you so edit accordingly and then COMMIT the changes.

5:: Now when the conflicts are solved , so Its time to Push / update our changes to the remote repo   hance push the changes.

---------> $ git push

*******And its done ***********
