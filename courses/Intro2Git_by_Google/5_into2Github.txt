we can clone a repo from github using the URL.
we will be asked for a username and password.

then we can update the changes done locally to the gitHub by using the Push

---->> $ git push

then to update the local cloned repo i.e in sync with github we can use Pull

---->$ git pull


for all these operations we need to input the username and password.

Hence to avoid these we can set a SSH-KEY pair a global key in the github profile , so that when we do anything , it recognises our computer.

OR

Another way is to cache the username and password in the git so that we did not need to fill it manually everytime.  but it is of a timelimit. usually 15 min.
Hence git does this by using a Credential Helper which cache the username and password.

----> $ git --config credential.helper cache

To Set the timelimit of the data cache use

---> $ git --config credential.helper 'cache --timeout=<time in sec>'

example:
---> $ git --config credential.helper 'cache --timeout=3600'   // seting timelimit for 1 hrs.
