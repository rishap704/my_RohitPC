 as we know the VCS tracks who made the changes to the file , Hence therfore we need to tell GIT who we are
Hence we use git config cmd to set user email and uaer name as shown below

---->> $ git config --global user.email "rishapsingh77@gmail.com"
---->> $ git config --global user.name "rishap777"
Here the --global flag means the that git will always use this info for anything we do on this machine.

If we want to override this with a different name then , run the command without --global option ****WHEN WE ARE IN THAT PROJECT***********
Hence for that project only the user name will be changed.

NOw to START we git 

we  can create a new empty gir repository or clone an existing repository.

---->>$ git init   // a git repsitories will be created in the current directory with various files used by the GIT itself. 
We should use the git commands to to modify these files and not touching/changing it directly.
eg. a config ,brances dir etc.

---->>$ git status   //to get some info abt the current working tree and the pending changes.

first we need to copy the desired files into the working tree
now if we use above cmd we can see the pending changes etc.

the files which is marked as to be committed , means the change is currently into the staging area.

To get it committed use

---->$ git commit file_v1.c  or $git commit
 after this cmd a default editor is opened  in which we need to type the commit message  /// there is various types of messages refer later docs for this.
 
 after commiting the file is tracked by the git
