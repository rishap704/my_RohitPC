Undoing Things:

After editing a file we can  udo the changes before statging by a 

----> $ git checkout <filename>  // it will undo the changes

if we staged the changes and then we want to udo the changes 

---> $ git restore <file name> 
or
----> $ git reset <filename>   //to undo all changes

or 

-->> $ git reset -p <filename>    // to undo the changes for the specific changed line of the codes.

************* amending changes ****************

It is used to alter the previous commit
eg ; let say you need to commit 2 file and u commit only 1 file but the commit mesaage was for both the file hence we can then add the remaining file and then use --amend flag to alter the previous commit

-------->>$ git commit --amend

Hnece the prevois commit is replaced by the this new commit and the previos commit wont be shown in git log.

Therefore never use this for public repo


****************** ROLL back ***************

It is used to undo change done in the previous commit ,it wont delete the previous commit it ,, instead it will create a file with removing the changes made in previous commit and then again commiting these changes.


---0---------> $ git revert HEAD  // this will revert to to the latest commit

To revert to the older commit we need to specify the  40 letters commit id 

0------------->$ git revert <commit id>  //only few initial of commit id can also work until unless it matches with the further letters.

**********to remove a cloned/created local repo******************

to remove the repo we need to rm the .git dir from the repo we need to delete
use
---->rm -rf .git	

and then ---> cd ..
 and 
then delete the repo directory
----> rm -r <repo dir name>
