Memory regions, types and attributes
The memory map and the programming of the optional MPU splits the memory map into regions. Each region has a defined memory type, and some regions have additional memory attributes. The memory type and attributes determine the behavior of accesses to the region.

The memory types are:

Normal
The processor can re-order transactions for efficiency, or perform speculative reads.

Device
The processor preserves transaction order relative to other transactions to Device or Strongly-ordered memory.

Strongly-ordered
The processor preserves transaction order relative to all other transactions.

The different ordering requirements for Device and Strongly-ordered memory mean that the memory system can buffer a write to Device memory, but must not buffer a write to Strongly-ordered memory.

The additional memory attributes include:

Shareable
For a shareable memory region that is implemented, the memory system provides data synchronization between bus masters in a system with multiple bus masters, for example, a processor with a DMA controller.

Strongly-ordered memory is always shareable.

If multiple bus masters can access a non-shareable memory region, software must ensure data coherency between the bus masters.

Note
This attribute is relevant only if the device is likely to be used in systems where memory is shared between multiple processors.

Execute Never (XN)
Means the processor prevents instruction accesses. A fault exception is generated only on execution of an instruction executed from an XN region.
